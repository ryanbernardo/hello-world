# hello-world
A project to learn how to use Github.


I'm an aspiring web developer. I have followed some coding classes like Codecademy, Udemy, Openclassrooms. Somehow I've never managed too stick with a program for too long. My goal is to get a job as a web developer in 2021. Let's make it happen!!!
